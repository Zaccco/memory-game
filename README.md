I used this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek&t=1484s) video by freeCodeCamp.org to figure out how to "flip" the cards and also how to shuffle them at the start of a game using CSS.

I also used this [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) article to help me set a timeout function to make sure that after the second card is pressed, it is being revealed for a second before flipping back over. Without this function, the second card was never flipped.
